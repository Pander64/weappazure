### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
Cost :
The costs of my services are cheaper thanks to the economy of the cloud that allows me to reduce these costs and not have such large investment costs to test the application.
Scalability: 
Azure services allow me to make a horizontal or vertical scaling in case of high concurrency in our web application.
availability: 
Cloud services provide me with a high availability of their services.
workflow:
I can place large workflows without fear of collapsing services thanks to the scalability of the cloud. 
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
I chose app service because it is an acutal application and it is more feasible for the issue of delegating services to azure where we only worry about the application and its security, access, etc.
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
that the application was in an legacy tengology, That the application needs more custom configurations with the operating system o necessary use of add-on software for application coding.
